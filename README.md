# Homework 1
Homework 1 for the R Shiny course, Spring 2023✨
[Final shiny app](https://mehussey.shinyapps.io/Homework1/)

I am using data from Kaggle on the environmental impact of food production. Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production

Some notes on the dataset: 
- Kg CO2 = Greenhouse emmisions(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product). These represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.
- Eutrophication: the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients. Occurs when the environment becomes enriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth to estuaries and coastal waters. Usually caused by fertilizers, animal feed, sewage discharge, etc.
